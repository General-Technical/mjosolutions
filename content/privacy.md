#### Data Loss Prevention

MJO Mortgage Solutions utilises Data Loss Prevention policies. A data loss prevention policy defines how organisations can share and protect data. It guides how data can be used in decision making without it being exposed to anyone who should not have access to it.

### Data loss prevention is broadly defined as technology or processes that:

&#8226; Identifies confidential data.

&#8226; Tracks data usage.

&#8226; Prevents unauthorized access to data.

Data loss prevention tools include software products that can classify and protect data. The data loss prevention policy guides how those tools work.

#### Why We Use A Data Loss Prevention Policy

Much of data security involves preventing malicious attacks on an organisation’s networks. Employees have more ways to access and share organizational data than in the past due to the distributed nature of modern computing making accidental data loss a serious problem.

Data storage is available in the cloud and remote locations. As the number of employees working from remote locations continues to increase, so too does frequency of access to sensitive data from laptops and mobile devices that may be vulnerable.

### Data collection and use are coming under increased regulatory scrutiny. There are three main reasons for establishing a data loss prevention policy:

&#8226; Compliance: Governments have various levels of regulation of how organisations collect and secure personally identifiable information. A data loss prevention policy is an important part of complying with data regulation and reporting information in compliance audits.

&#8226; Intellectual property: Proprietary information and trade secrets are the types of information that needs to be protected from unauthorised access.

&#8226; Data visibility: Organizations can gain valuable insights by monitoring how stakeholders’ access and interact with data.

#### Our Practices for Establishing A Data Loss Prevention Policy

Data loss prevention policies help us prevent unauthorised data access and protect us from the potential damage.

### While no protection will be bulletproof, we use the following practices that can help us implement successful data protection policies:

&#8226; Identify the data that the policy is primarily meant to protect. Most often data is classified according to its vulnerability and risk factors. Taking the time to understand data and classify it can lead to greater insights for us.

&#8226; Establish criteria for evaluating data loss prevention vendors. Creating an evaluation framework with the right questions can help lead to an educated purchasing decision.

&#8226; Clearly define the roles of people who will be involved with data loss prevention. This is not just about who will monitor data usage and make the rules. Segregating responsibilities helps prevent misuse.

&#8226; Keeping it simple at the beginning. The goal is to secure the most critical data and get a measurable win early, then build upon that.

&#8226; Each area of MJO Mortgage Solutions has a role in shaping a data loss prevention policy that aligns with corporate culture. This is a strategy that affects all departments and functions.

&#8226; Educating everyone in MJO Mortgage Solutions about how and why the data loss prevention policy is in place.

&#8226; Document the data loss prevention processes carefully. A written policy should focus on the data being protected.

&#8226; Setting and sharing metrics for success.

&#8226; Anticipate workarounds to limits (e.g. If email rules prevent large files from being attached, employees find other ways to transfer files). We examine workflows to make sure data loss prevention policies does not get in the way of us doing our jobs.

&#8226; Assess how much data is needed (what kind of data is needed and why). Do not save unnecessary data.

&#8226; Monitor data usage before blocking it. Set up data loss prevention tools to report sensitive data loss first.

#### Using Data Loss Prevention Policy Templates

We craft our data loss prevention policies based on our unique security environment and communicate it across the company.

There are a number of data privacy laws already in effect, not to mention the host of pending legal requirements and potential laws being penned across the globe.

### Our data loss prevention policy contains three elements:

&#8226; Location: Where the policy will be enforced.

&#8226; Condition: The parameters the policy searches for to prevent data loss.

&#8226; Action: If a situation meets the set conditions, an action is taken to prevent loss.
